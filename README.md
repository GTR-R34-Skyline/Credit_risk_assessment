Problem Statement 2: Real-Time Credit Risk Assessment Using Alternative
 Data
 Track: Analytics, Finance
 Objective:
 Develop a system that assesses credit risk in real time by analyzing traditional financial data
 and alternative data sources like social media, utility payments, and spending habits.
 Description:
 Many individuals lack sufficient credit history to access traditional lending products, despite
 having steady income or positive financial behavior. This solution will:
 1. Aggregate and process alternative data sources alongside traditional credit information.
 2. Use machine learning models to predict creditworthiness.
 3. Provide lenders with transparent, explainable credit risk scores.
 Tasks:
 1. Build a pipeline to collect and integrate alternative data sources, such as social media
 sentiment, geolocation data, and utility payment records.
 2. Train a machine learning model to predict default risk using a combination of traditional
 and alternative features.
 3. Ensure explainability.

We have developed a solution with this in mind.
Hope you find it useful.
